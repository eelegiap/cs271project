Part I (Lady with a dog).
 They said that a new face appeared on the embankment: a lady with a dog.
Dmitri Dmitrich Gurov, who had already lived in Yalta for two weeks and was used to it, also began to take an interest in new faces.
Sitting in Vernet's pavilion, he saw a young lady, a short blonde woman in a beret, walk along the embankment; a white spitz ran after her.
And then he met her in the city garden and in the square several times a day.
She walked alone, still in the same beret, with a white spitz; no one knew who she was, and they called her just like that: a lady with a dog.
“If she is here without a husband and without acquaintances,” Gurov reflected, “then it would not be superfluous to get to know her.”
He was not yet forty, but he already had a daughter of twelve years old and two sons who were high school students.
He was married early, when he was still a second-year student, and now his wife seemed one and a half times his age.
She was a tall woman with dark eyebrows, direct, important, solid and, as she called herself, thinking.
She read a lot, did not write in letters b, called her husband not Dmitry, but Dimitri, and he secretly considered her narrow-minded, narrow, inelegant, was afraid of her and did not like to be at home.
He began to cheat on her a long time ago, he cheated often and, probably, therefore, he almost always spoke badly about women, and when they were spoken about in his presence, he called them like this: - Inferior race!
It seemed to him that he had learned enough from bitter experience to call them anything, but still, without the "inferior race", he could not live even two days.
In the company of men he was bored, uncomfortable, with them he was taciturn, cold, but when he was among women, he felt free and knew what to talk about with them and how to behave; and even keeping silent with them was easy for him.
In his appearance, in his character, in his whole nature there was something attractive, elusive, which disposed women to him, attracted them; he knew about it, and some force attracted him to them too.
Repeated experience, really bitter experience, taught him long ago that any rapprochement, which at first so pleasantly diversifies life and seems like a sweet and easy adventure, among decent people, especially Muscovites, heavy on their feet, indecisive, inevitably grows into a whole task, extremely difficult, and the situation eventually becomes onerous.
But at every new meeting with an interesting woman, this experience somehow slipped from memory, and one wanted to live, and everything seemed so simple and amusing.
And then one evening he was having dinner in the garden, and the lady in the beret came up slowly to take the next table.
Her expression, gait, dress, hairstyle told him that she was from a decent society, married, in Yalta for the first time and alone, that she was bored here ...
There is a lot of untruth in the stories about the impurity of local customs, he despised them and knew that such stories were mostly composed by people who themselves would willingly sin if they knew how, but when the lady sat down at the next table three steps away from him, he remembered these stories of easy victories, trips to the mountains, and the seductive thought of a quick, fleeting connection, of an affair with an unknown woman whom you do not know by name and surname, suddenly took possession of him.
He affectionately beckoned the Spitz to him and, when he approached, shook his finger at him.
Spitz growled.
Gurov threatened again.
The lady looked at him and immediately lowered her eyes.
"He doesn't bite," she said, and blushed.
— Can I give him a bone?
- And when she nodded her head in the affirmative, he asked affably: - Have you deigned to come to Yalta for a long time?
- Five days.
- And I'm already here for the second week.
They were silent for a bit.
“Time goes fast, and yet it’s so boring here!” she said without looking at him.
- It's just customary to say that it's boring here.
The inhabitant lives somewhere in Belev or Zhizdra - and he is not bored, but will come here: “Ah, bored!
Ah, the dust!
You will think that he came from Grenada.
She laughed.
Then both continued to eat in silence, like strangers; but after dinner they went side by side - and a playful, light conversation began among free, contented people, who don't care where they go or what they talk about.
They walked and talked about how strangely the sea was lit; the water was lilac in color, so soft and warm, and there was a golden streak across it from the moon.
We talked about how stuffy it was after a hot day.
Gurov said that he was a Muscovite, a philologist by training, but worked in a bank; once prepared to sing in a private opera, but gave up, has two houses in Moscow ...
And from her he learned that she grew up in St. Petersburg, but married in S., where she has been living for two years, that she will stay in Yalta for another month and her husband, who also wants to relax, will come for her.
She could not explain in any way where her husband served - in the provincial government or in the provincial zemstvo council, and this was ridiculous to her.
And Gurov also found out that her name was Anna Sergeevna.
Then, in his room, he thought about her, that tomorrow she would probably meet him.
It should be.
Going to bed, he remembered that she had been a college student so recently, she was studying, just like now his daughter, he remembered how much more timidity, angularity was in her laughter, in a conversation with a stranger - this must be the first time in her life she she was alone, in such an environment when they go after her, and look at her, and talk to her with only one secret purpose, about which she cannot but guess.
He remembered her thin, weak neck, her beautiful, gray eyes.
“There is something pitiful about her after all,” he thought, and began to fall asleep.
 Part II (Lady with a dog).
It's been a week since we met.
It was a holiday.
The rooms were stuffy, and the streets were full of dust and hats were torn off.
He was thirsty all day, and Gurov often went into the pavilion and offered Anna Sergeevna now water with syrup, now ice cream.
There was nowhere to go.
In the evening, when it had calmed down a little, they went to the pier to see how the steamer would arrive.
There were many walkers on the pier; gathered to meet someone, holding bouquets.
And here two features of the elegant Yalta crowd were clearly evident: the elderly ladies were dressed like young ones, and there were many generals.
Due to rough seas, the steamer arrived late, when the sun had already set, and before landing at the pier, it took a long time to turn around.
Anna Sergeevna looked through her lorgnette at the ship and at the passengers, as if searching for acquaintances, and when she turned to Gurov, her eyes shone.
She talked a lot, and her questions were abrupt, and she herself immediately forgot what she was asking about; then she lost her lorgnette in the crowd.
The elegant crowd was dispersing, no faces could be seen, the wind had died down completely, and Gurov and Anna Sergeevna stood, as if waiting to see if anyone else would get off the ship.
Anna Sergeevna was already silent and sniffed the flowers, not looking at Gurov.
“The weather got better in the evening,” he said.
- Where are we going now?
Shouldn't we go somewhere?
She didn't answer.
Then he gazed fixedly at her, and suddenly embraced her and kissed her on the lips, and he was bathed in the scent and moisture of the flowers, and immediately he looked round timidly: had anyone seen it? "Let's go to you..." he said softly.
And both went fast.
Her room was stuffy, smelling of perfume she had bought from a Japanese store.
Gurov, looking at her now, thought: "There are so many meetings in life!"
From the past, he retained the memory of carefree, good-natured women, cheerful with love, grateful to him for happiness, even if it was very short; and about those - like, for example, his wife - who loved without sincerity, with excessive talk, mannered, with hysteria, with such an expression as if it were not love, not passion, but something more significant; and about two or three of them, very beautiful, cold, who suddenly flashed a predatory expression on their faces, a stubborn desire to take, snatch more from life than it can give, and these were not the first youth, capricious, not reasoning, domineering, not smart women, and when Gurov lost interest in them, their beauty aroused hatred in him, and the lace on their underwear then seemed to him like scales.
But there is still the same timidity, the angularity of inexperienced youth, an awkward feeling; and there was an impression of confusion, as if someone had suddenly knocked on the door.
Anna Sergeevna, that "lady with the dog," took what had happened in a special way, very seriously, as if she were her own fall—that's how it seemed, and it was strange and inopportune.
Her features drooped, withered, and long hair hung sadly on the sides of her face, she thought in a sad pose, like a sinner in an old picture.
 “Not good,” she said.
"You're the first one who doesn't respect me now."
There was a watermelon on the table in the room.
Gurov cut himself a slice and began to eat slowly.
At least half an hour passed in silence.
Anna Sergeevna was touching, she exuded the purity of a decent, naive, short-lived woman; a single candle burning on the table barely illuminated her face, but it was clear that she was not feeling well in her soul.
Why would I stop respecting you? Gurov asked.
“You don't know what you're talking about.
May God forgive me! she said, and her eyes filled with tears.
- It's horrible.
“You are definitely correct.
- How can I justify myself?
I am a bad, low woman, I despise myself and do not think of justification.
I did not deceive my husband, but myself.
And not only now, but for a long time I have been deceiving.
My husband may be an honest, good man, but he's a lackey!
I do not know what he does there, how he serves, but I only know that he is a lackey.
I was twenty years old when I married him, I was tormented by curiosity, I wanted something better; there is, I said to myself, another life.
I wanted to live!
Live and live...
Curiosity got me...
you don’t understand this, but, I swear to God, I could no longer control myself, something was being done to me, it was impossible to keep me, I told my husband that I was sick, and went here ...
And here she kept walking around, as if in a frenzy, like a mad woman ... and now I have become a vulgar, wretched woman whom anyone can despise.
Gurov was already bored listening to him, he was annoyed by the naive tone, this repentance, so unexpected and inappropriate; if not for the tears in her eyes, one would think that she was joking or playing a role.
"I don't understand," he said quietly, "what do you want?"
She hid her face in his chest and pressed herself against him.
"Believe me, believe me, I beg you..." she said.
“I love an honest, pure life, but sin is disgusting to me, I myself don’t know what I’m doing.
Ordinary people say: the unclean has beguiled.
And I can now say to myself that I was beguiled by an unclean one.
“Enough, enough…” he muttered.
He looked into her motionless, frightened eyes, kissed her, spoke quietly and kindly, and she gradually calmed down, and her gaiety returned to her; both began to laugh.
Then, when they came out, there was not a soul on the embankment, the city with its cypress trees looked completely dead, but the sea was still noisy and beat against the shore; one launch was rocking on the waves, and a lantern flickered sleepily on it.
We found a cab and drove to Oreanda.
“I just recognized your name downstairs in the hall: von Diederitz is written on the board,” said Gurov.
Is your husband German?
- No, it seems that his grandfather was a German, but he himself is Orthodox.
In Oreanda they sat on a bench not far from the church, looked down at the sea and were silent.
Yalta was barely visible through the morning fog, white clouds stood motionless on the mountain tops.
The leaves did not stir on the trees, the cicadas called, and the monotonous, dull sound of the sea, coming from below, spoke of peace, of the eternal sleep that awaits us.
It was so noisy downstairs, when neither Yalta nor Oreanda was here, now it is noisy and will be noisy just as indifferently and deafly when we are gone.
And in this constancy, in complete indifference to the life and death of each of us, lies, perhaps, the guarantee of our eternal salvation, the uninterrupted movement of life on earth, uninterrupted perfection.
Sitting next to a young woman who at dawn seemed so beautiful, reassured and enchanted by the sight of this fabulous setting - the sea, mountains, clouds, the wide sky, Gurov thought about how, in essence, if you think about it, everything is beautiful in this world, everything except what we ourselves think and do when we forget about the higher goals of being, about our human dignity.
A man came up—probably a watchman—looked at them and left.
And this detail seemed so mysterious and also beautiful.
It could be seen how the steamer came from Feodosia, illuminated by the morning dawn, already without lights.
"Dew on the grass," said Anna Sergeevna after a silence.
- Yes.
Time to go home.
They returned to the city.
Then every afternoon they met on the embankment, had breakfast together, dined, walked, admired the sea.
She complained that she was not sleeping well and that her heart was beating uneasily, she kept asking the same questions, worried now by jealousy, now by fear that he did not respect her enough.
And often in the square or in the garden, when there was no one near them, he would suddenly draw her to him and kiss her passionately.
Perfect idleness, these kisses in broad daylight, with an eye and fear, as if someone did not see, the heat, the smell of the sea and the constant flickering before the eyes of idle, smart, well-fed people definitely reborn him; he spoke to Anna Sergeevna about how good she was, how seductive, was impatiently passionate, did not leave her a single step, but she often thought and kept asking him to confess that he did not respect her, did not love her at all, but only saw her in her a vulgar woman.
Almost every evening later they went somewhere out of town, to Oreanda or to a waterfall; and the walk was a success, the impressions were invariably beautiful and majestic every time.
Waiting for my husband to come.
But a letter came from him, in which he announced that his eyes hurt, and begged his wife to return home as soon as possible.
Anna Sergeevna was in a hurry.
"It's good that I'm leaving," she said to Gurov.
“It is fate itself.
She went on horseback and he accompanied her.
We drove all day.
When she got into the carriage of the courier train and when the second bell rang, she said: - Give me, I'll look at you again ...
I'll take another look.
Like this.
She did not cry, but was sad, as if she were ill, and her face was trembling.
“I will think about you ... remember you,” she said.
- The Lord is with you, stay.
Do not remember dashingly.
We say goodbye forever, this is so necessary, because we should not have met at all.
Well, the Lord is with you.
The train left quickly, its lights soon disappeared, and a minute later there was no more noise, as if everything had been conspired on purpose in order to quickly stop this sweet oblivion, this madness.
And, left alone on the platform and looking into the dark distance, Gurov listened to the cry of the grasshoppers and the hum of the telegraph wires with such a feeling as if he had just woken up.
And he thought that there had been another adventure or adventure in his life, and that too had already ended, and now the memory remained ...
He was touched, sad and slightly remorseful; for this young woman, whom he would never see again, was not happy with him; he was friendly and cordial to her, but still in his treatment of her, in his tone and caresses, there was a shadow of slight mockery, the rude arrogance of a happy man who, moreover, was almost twice her age.
All the time she called him kind, unusual, sublime; obviously, he seemed to her not what he really was, which means that he unwittingly deceived her ...
Here at the station it already smelled of autumn, the evening was cool.
“It's time for me to go north,” thought Gurov, leaving the platform.
"It's time!"
Part III (Lady with a dog).
At home in Moscow everything was already winter-like, the stoves were stoked, and in the mornings, when the children gathered for the gymnasium and drank tea, it was dark, and the nurse lit the fire for a short time.
The frost has already begun.
When the first snow falls, on the first day of sledding, it is pleasant to see the white earth, white roofs, one breathes softly, gloriously, and at this time one remembers one's youth.
Old lindens and birches, white with hoarfrost, have a good-natured expression, they are closer to the heart than cypresses and palm trees, and near them one no longer wants to think about mountains and the sea.
Gurov was a Muscovite, he returned to Moscow on a fine, frosty day, and when he put on a fur coat and warm gloves and walked along Petrovka, and when on Saturday evening he heard the ringing of bells, the recent trip and the places he had been lost everything for him the charm.
Little by little, he plunged into Moscow life, already eagerly read three newspapers a day and said that he did not read Moscow newspapers on principle.
He was already drawn to restaurants, clubs, dinner parties, anniversaries, and he was already flattered that he had famous lawyers and artists, and that in the doctor's club he played cards with a professor.
Already he could eat a whole portion of the village woman in a frying pan ...
Some month would pass, and Anna Sergeevna, it seemed to him, would be covered in a fog in his memory and only occasionally would dream with a touching smile, as others dreamed.
But more than a month had passed, a deep winter had come, and everything was clear in his memory, as if he had parted from Anna Sergeevna only yesterday.
And the memories flared up more and more.
Whether in the evening silence the voices of the children who were preparing lessons were heard in his office, whether he heard a romance or an organ in a restaurant, or a blizzard howled in the fireplace, when suddenly everything was resurrected in his memory: both what was on the pier, and early morning with fog on mountains, and the steamer from Feodosia, and kisses.
He walked around the room for a long time and remembered, and smiled, and then the memories turned into dreams, and the past in his imagination interfered with what would be.
Anna Sergeevna did not dream of him, but followed him everywhere, like a shadow, and followed him.
Closing his eyes, he saw her as if alive, and she seemed more beautiful, younger, more tender than she was; and he himself seemed to himself better than he was then, in Yalta.
In the evenings she looked at him from the bookcase, from the fireplace, from the corner, he heard her breathing, the gentle rustle of her clothes.
On the street, he followed the women with his eyes, looking for someone like her ...
And already tormented by a strong desire to share with someone their memories.
But at home it was impossible to talk about your love, and outside the house - there was no one with whom.
Not with the tenants, and not in the bank.
And what to talk about?
Did he love then?
Was there anything beautiful, poetic, or instructive, or simply interesting in his relationship with Anna Sergeevna?
And I had to talk vaguely about love, about women, and no one guessed what was the matter, and only the wife moved her dark eyebrows and said: “The role of a veil does not suit you at all, Dimitri.”
One night, leaving the doctor's club with his partner, an official, he could not resist and said: - If you only knew what a charming woman I met in Yalta!
The official got into the sleigh and drove off, but suddenly turned around and called out: "Dmitry Dmitritch!"
- What?
- And just now you were right: sturgeon with a smell!
These words, so ordinary, for some reason suddenly angered Gurov, seemed to him humiliating and unclean.
What wild manners, what faces!
What senseless nights, what uninteresting, imperceptible days!
A frantic game of cards, gluttony, drunkenness, constant talking all about one thing.
Unnecessary deeds and conversations all about the same thing take away the best part of the time, the best strength, and in the end there is some kind of short, wingless life, some kind of nonsense, and you can’t leave and run away, as if you were sitting in a madhouse or in a prison cell. companies!
Gurov did not sleep all night and was indignant and then spent the whole day with a headache.
And in the following nights he slept badly, kept sitting in bed and thinking or walking from corner to corner.
He was tired of children, tired of the bank, he did not want to go anywhere, talk about anything.
In December, during the holidays, he got ready for the road and told his wife that he was leaving for St. Petersburg to work for a young man, and he left for St. Why?
He himself did not know well.
He wanted to see Anna Sergeevna and talk, arrange a meeting, if possible.
He arrived in S. in the morning and took the best room in the hotel, where the entire floor was covered with gray soldier's cloth and there was an inkwell on the table, gray with dust, with a rider on a horse, whose hand was raised with a hat, and his head was beaten off.
The porter gave him the necessary information: von Diederitz lives on Staro-Goncharnaya Street, in his own house - it's not far from the hotel, lives well, richly, has his own horses, everyone in the city knows him.
The doorman spoke like this: Drydyrits.
Gurov slowly went to Staro-Goncharnaya and found a house.
Just opposite the house stretched a fence, gray, long, with nails.
"You'll run away from such a fence," thought Gurov, glancing first at the windows, then at the fence.
He thought: today is a non-present day, and the husband is probably at home.
And anyway, it would be tactless to enter the house and embarrass.
If you send a note, then it will probably fall into the hands of your husband, and then everything can be ruined.
It's best to leave it to chance.
And he kept walking along the street and near the fence and waited for this opportunity.
He saw a beggar enter the gate and be attacked by dogs, then, an hour later, he heard the piano playing, and the sounds came faint, indistinct.
Anna Sergeevna must have been playing.
The front door suddenly opened, and an old woman came out, followed by a familiar white Spitz.
Gurov wanted to call the dog, but his heart suddenly began to beat, and from excitement he could not remember the name of the spitz.
He walked and hated the gray fence more and more, and was already thinking with irritation that Anna Sergeevna had forgotten about him and, perhaps, was already amusing herself with another, and this is so natural in the position of a young woman who is forced to see this damn fence.
He returned to his room and sat on the sofa for a long time, not knowing what to do, then had dinner, then slept for a long time.
“How stupid and restless it all is,” he thought, waking up and looking at the dark windows; it was already evening.
- That's why I slept for some reason.
What am I going to do at night now?
He sat on a bed covered with a cheap gray blanket, like a hospital blanket, and teased himself with annoyance: “Here’s the lady with the dog for you ...
Here's your adventure...
So sit here."
Already in the morning, at the station, a poster with very large letters caught his eye: “Geisha” was on for the first time.
He remembered this and went to the theater.
 “It is very possible that she is at the first performances,” he thought.
The theater was full.
And here, as in general in all provincial theaters, there was fog above the chandelier, the gallery was noisily worried; in the front row, before the start of the performance, local dandies stood with their hands folded back; and here, in the governor's box, in the first place sat the governor's daughter in a boa, and the governor himself modestly hid behind a curtain, and only his hands were visible; the curtain swayed, the orchestra took a long time to tune in.
All the time while the audience was entering and taking their seats, Gurov eagerly searched with his eyes.
Anna Sergeevna also entered.
She sat down in the third row, and when Gurov looked at her, his heart sank, and he clearly understood that for him now in the whole world there was no closer, dearer and more important person; she, lost in the provincial crowd, this little woman, unremarkable in any way, with a vulgar lorgnette in her hands, now filled his whole life, was his grief, joy, the only happiness he now desired for himself; and to the sounds of a bad orchestra, of crappy philistine violins, he thought about how good she was.
I thought and dreamed.
Together with Anna Sergeevna, a young man with small whiskers, very tall and round-shouldered, came in and sat down beside him; he shook his head at every step, and seemed to be constantly bowing.
It was probably her husband, whom she then in Yalta, in a fit of bitter feeling, called a lackey.
And in fact, in his long figure, in his whiskers, in his small bald head there was something of a lackey-modesty, he smiled sweetly, and in his buttonhole a kind of learned badge gleamed, like a footman's number.
In the first intermission, the husband went to smoke, she remained in the chair.
Gurov, who was also sitting in the stalls, went up to her and said in a trembling voice, smiling forcibly: "Hello."
She glanced at him and turned pale, then looked again with horror, not believing her eyes, and firmly clenched her fan and lorgnette in her hands, apparently struggling with herself so as not to faint.
Both were silent.
She sat, he stood, frightened by her embarrassment, not daring to sit next to her.
The tuned violins and flute began to sing, it suddenly became frightening, it seemed that they were watching from all the boxes.
But then she got up and quickly went to the exit; he followed her, and both walked confusedly, along the corridors, down the stairs, now going up, now going down, and some people in judicial, teacher's and specific uniforms flashed before their eyes, and all with badges; ladies flashed by, fur coats on hangers, a through wind blew, dousing with the smell of tobacco butts.
And Gurov, whose heart was beating violently, thought: “Oh my God!
And why these people, this orchestra ... "
And at that moment he suddenly remembered how that evening at the station, after seeing Anna Sergeyevna off, he had told himself that it was all over and they would never see each other again.
But what a long way to go!
On the narrow, gloomy stairs, where it was written "Entrance to the amphitheatre," she stopped.
- How you scared me! she said, breathing heavily, still pale, stunned.
“Oh, how you frightened me!
I'm barely alive.
Why did you come?
What for? "But understand, Anna, understand..." he said in an undertone, hurrying.
I beg you, please understand...
She looked at him with fear, with pleading, with love, she looked intently in order to keep his features in her memory more firmly.
- I suffer so much! she went on, not listening to him.
- All the time I thought only about you, I lived in thoughts about you.
And I wanted to forget, forget, but why, why did you come?
Higher up, on the landing, two schoolboys were smoking and looking down, but Gurov did not care, he drew Anna Sergeevna to him and began kissing her face, cheeks, hands.
- What are you doing, what are you doing! she said in horror, pulling him away from her.
- You and I are crazy.
Leave today, leave now...
I conjure you with all the saints, I beg you ...
Here they go!
Someone was walking up the stairs.
"You must leave..." Anna Sergeevna continued in a whisper.
Do you hear, Dmitri Dmitritch?
I will come to you in Moscow.
I have never been happy, I am now unhappy and will never, never be happy, never!
Don't make me suffer any more!
I swear I will come to Moscow.
And now let's part!
My dear, kind, my dear, let's part!
She shook hands with him and began to quickly go downstairs, looking back at him, and it was clear from her eyes that she really was not happy.
Gurov stood a little, listened, then, when everything was quiet, he found his hanger and left the theatre.
 Part IV (Lady with a dog).
 And Anna Sergeevna began to come to him in Moscow.
Once every two or three months she left S. and told her husband that she was going to consult with the professor about her female illness - and her husband believed and did not believe.
Arriving in Moscow, she stopped at the "Slavianski Bazaar" and immediately sent a man in a red cap to Gurov.
Gurov went to see her, and no one in Moscow knew about it.
Once he went to her in this way on a winter morning (the messenger was with him the night before and did not find him).
With him was his daughter, whom he wanted to take to the gymnasium, it was on the way.
Heavy wet snow fell.
"It's three degrees now, and meanwhile it's snowing," Gurov said to his daughter.
- But this heat is only on the surface of the earth, in the upper layers of the atmosphere the temperature is completely different.
“Daddy, why doesn’t thunder happen in winter?”
He explained that too.
He talked and thought about the fact that here he is going on a date and not a single living soul knows about it and probably never will know.
He had two lives: one explicit, which was seen and known by everyone who needed it, full of conditional truth and conditional deceit, completely similar to the life of his acquaintances and friends, and the other - proceeding secretly.
And by some strange coincidence, perhaps accidental, everything that was important to him, interesting, necessary, in which he was sincere and did not deceive himself, which was the grain of his life, came secretly from others, nevertheless, what was his lie, his shell in which he hid to hide the truth, such as his work in a bank, disputes in a club, his "inferior race", going with his wife on anniversaries - all this was obvious.
And he judged others by himself, did not believe what he saw, and always assumed that every person, under the cover of mystery, as under the cover of night, passes his real, most interesting life.
Every personal existence rests on secrecy, and perhaps this is partly why civilized people are so nervously concerned about respecting personal secrecy.
After seeing his daughter to the gymnasium, Gurov went to the "Slavianski Bazaar".
He took off his fur coat below, went upstairs and softly knocked on the door.
Anna Sergeevna, dressed in his favorite gray dress, tired from the journey and waiting, had been waiting for him since yesterday evening; she was pale, looked at him and did not smile, and as soon as he entered, she already clung to his chest.
It was as if they had not seen each other for two years, their kiss was long, long.
- Well, how do you live there? - he asked.
- What's new?
"Wait, I'll tell you now...
I can not.
She could not speak because she was crying.
She turned away from him and pressed the handkerchief over her eyes.
"Well, let him cry, and I'll sit for now," he thought, and sat down in an armchair.
Then he called and said to bring him tea; and then, when he drank tea, she still stood with her face turned to the window...
She wept with excitement, with the mournful consciousness that their life had turned out so sadly; they only see each other in secret, hiding from people like thieves!
Isn't their life broken?
- Well, stop it! - he said.
It was obvious to him that this love of theirs would not end soon, no one knows when.
Anna Sergeevna became more and more attached to him, adored him, and it would be unthinkable to tell her that all this must someday have an end; she wouldn't have believed it.
He went up to her and took her by the shoulders to caress, joke, and at that time he saw himself in the mirror.
His head was already starting to turn gray.
And it seemed strange to him that he had aged so much in recent years, had become so ugly.
The shoulders on which his hands rested were warm and quivering.
He felt compassion for this life, still so warm and beautiful, but probably already close to fading and withering, like his life.
Why does she love him so?
He always seemed to women not to be what he was, and they loved in him not himself, but the man whom their imagination created and whom they eagerly sought in their life; and then, when they noticed their mistake, they still loved.
And none of them were happy with him.
Time passed, he got acquainted, converged, parted, but never loved; It was anything but love.
And only now, when his head turned gray, did he fall in love, properly, for real - for the first time in his life.
Anna Sergeevna and he loved each other like very close, dear people, like husband and wife, like tender friends; it seemed to them that fate itself had destined them for each other, and it was not clear why he was married, and she was married; and it was as if they were two migratory birds, a male and a female, who were caught and forced to live in separate cages.
They forgave each other what they were ashamed of in their past, forgave everything in the present and felt that this love of theirs had changed them both.
Previously, in sad moments, he calmed himself with all sorts of reasoning that came into his head, but now he had no time for reasoning, he felt deep compassion, he wanted to be sincere, tender ... "Stop it, my dear," he said.
- She cried - and will ...
Now let's talk, we'll figure something out.
Then they consulted for a long time, talked about how to save themselves from the need to hide, deceive, live in different cities, not see each other for a long time.
How to get rid of these unbearable fetters?
- How? How? he asked, clutching his head.
- How?
And it seemed that a little more - and the solution would be found, and then a new, wonderful life would begin; and it was clear to both that the end was still far, far away, and that the most complex and difficult was only just beginning.
