            <h6>How were the alignments created?</h6>
            <p>The words and sentences in the original and translated texts were aligned computationally
                with manual corrections. The machine sentence alignment uses <a
                    href="https://github.com/rsennrich/Bleualign" target="_blank">Bleualign</a>, an algorithm for
                aligning parallel texts that compares Bleu similarity scores between the machine-translated original and
                the human-translated text. Once the sentences are aligned, we aligned words using <a
                    href='https://github.com/cisnlp/simalign' target='_blank'>SimAlign</a>, an open-source tool that
                aligns words in parallel sentences using pretrained language models. Our alignments are based on mBERT,
                which is supported in 104 languages. We processed the texts into tokens using the popular Python library
                <a href="https://spacy.io/usage/models/" target="_blank">Spacy</a>. Metrics seen in the graphs are based
                on different counting methods from corpus linguistics.
