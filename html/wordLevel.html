        <h6>Alignment Explorer</h6>
        <span class="tooltiptext">This visualization requires a word to be selected (clicked) in the texts. Once a word is selected, the alignment explorer displays three related concepts from left to right: 1) the number of times that the selected word is not translated as the immediate translation (the aligned translation), 2) the number of times that the selected word is translated as the immediate translation, and 3) the number of times that the immediate translation is not translated as the selected word. Hovering over segments of the visualization will provide specific information on the frequencies of these phenomena.</span>
